# CommentAnalysis
Comment Analysis on Open Source Software Projects

## About this Project
This is a project about analyzing comments in existing open source projects, such as the distribution pattern and content of comments. We plan to work on projects of different programming languages and application domains. After that, we plan to develop an automation tool for identification of poorly commented areas and suggestions about where to add comments and what type of comments to add.

## Project Configuration and Guidelines
Personally I recommend VS Code with Python extension and Pylint enabled. For coding, the [PEP8 Style Guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) should be followed. This project uses Python 3.

No automatically generated data should be uploaded to this repository, except that it is significant result and need to be saved. For temporary data, it should be generated in `temp/` folder. For significant result, it should be manually moved to the `result/` folder.
